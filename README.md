# AI-Based Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This AI-based recommendation system is designed to match students with appropriate alumni based on their interests, sector, skills, and current industry. The system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to provide accurate and personalized recommendations, enhancing the networking and mentorship experience for students.

## Features
- **Student-Alumni Matching**: Recommends alumni based on students' interests, sectors, skills, and current industry.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes state-of-the-art ML models for accurate and personalized recommendations.
- **Google Colab**: The project is primarily developed and executed in a Google Colab notebook, ensuring ease of access and collaboration.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a seamless and intuitive interface for both students and alumni.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zues0613/AI-BASED-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM.git
    cd AI-BASED-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
    ```
2. Open the Google Colab notebook:
    - Navigate to the `ProfileMatchingRecommendation.ipynb` file in your GitHub repository.
    - Click on the "Open in Colab" button to open the notebook in Google Colab.

## Usage
To run the recommendation system:
1. Open the `ProfileMatchingRecommendation.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to train the model and generate recommendations.
